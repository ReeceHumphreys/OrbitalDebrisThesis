	abstract = {At the beginning of the twenty-first century there was considerable effort made using evolutionary models to assess the effectiveness of post-mission disposal (PMD) and other mitigation measures to stabilise the growth of the debris population in low Earth orbit (LEO). Subsequently, this activity led to the recommendation of a ?25-year rule? for the post-mission disposal of spacecraft and orbital stages intersecting the LEO region. At the time, it was anticipated that the 25-year rule, together with passivation and suppression of mission-related debris, would be sufficient to prevent the continued growth of the LEO debris population. However, in the last decade both the LEO debris environment and the debris modelling capability have seen significant changes. In particular, recent population growth has been driven by a number of major break-ups, including the intentional destruction of the Fengyun-1C spacecraft and the collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. State-of-the-art evolutionary models now indicate that mitigation measures alone are insufficient to stabilise the LEO debris population. Consequently, this has led to considerable interest in the remediation of the debris environment and, especially, in debris removal. Yet there is a reluctance to revisit the role of PMD within the wider goal of remediation even though it does not provide the solution that was expected. Thus, there is a risk that the approach to remediation will follow a sequential, ?over-the-fence? philosophy, which tends to deliver costly, and less than optimal solutions. In this paper, we present a new and large study of debris mitigation and removal using the University of Southampton?s evolutionary model, DAMAGE, together with the latest MASTER model population of objects \&gt; 10 cm in LEO. Here, we have employed a concurrent approach to remediation, whereby changes to the PMD rule and the inclusion of other mitigation measures have been considered alongside multiple removal strategies. In this way, we have been able to demonstrate the synergy of these measures and to identify aggregate solutions to the space debris problem. The results suggest that reducing the PMD decay rule offers benefits that include an increase in the effectiveness of debris removal and a corresponding increase in the confidence that these combined measures will lead to the stabilisation of the LEO debris population.}

	title = {Space debris cloud evolution in {Low} {Earth} {Orbit}},
	abstract = {The Earth is surrounded by inoperative objects generated from past and current space missions. Because of the high orbital speed, even the impact with small fragments is a hazard to operational spacecraft as it could lead to the partial or complete loss of the mission. Therefore, it is important to assess the collision risk due to space debris considering small fragments, which are usually not included in space debris modelling because their large number would make simulations extremely complex. In this work, an analytical approach is developed to describe the evolution of debris clouds created by fragmentations in Low Earth Orbit. In contrast to traditional approaches, which follow the trajectory of individual fragments, with the proposed method the cloud behaviour is studied globally, so that the presence of small fragments can be modelled. This give a deeper insight into the dynamics of debris clouds and reduces the computational effort needed to estimate the consequences of a collision. A standard breakup model is used to describe the dispersion of the fragments in terms of characteristic length, area-to mass ratio and velocity. From the velocity distribution, the fragment spatial dispersion is derived. The cloud density is expressed by a continuous function that depends on the altitude and that is set as initial condition for the orbit propagation. Based on an analytical approach proposed in the literature for interplanetary dust and spacecraft swarms, the fragment cloud evolution in time is derived through the continuity equation, which is used to describe the variation of debris density considering the effect of atmospheric drag. The approach has been extended to express the cloud density as a function of multiple orbital parameters and to model additional perturbations such as the Earth’s oblateness. The method has been validated through the comparison with the traditional numerical propagation and then applied to study many breakup scenarios. The proposed approach proves to be flexible and able to study the collision risk coming from several breakup events and to evaluate the vulnerability of different targets. It is also applied to derive an index of the environmental criticality of spacecraft.},

	abstract = {Analyses of the fragmentation (due to explosions and collisions) of spacecraft and rocket bodies in low Earth orbit (LEO) have been performed this year at NASA/JSC. The overall goals of this study have been to achieve a better understanding of the results of fragmentations on the orbital debris environment and then to implement this understanding into the breakup model of EVOLVE 4.0. The previous breakup model implemented in EVOLVE 3.0 and other long-term orbital debris environment models was known to be inadequate in two major areas. First, it treated all fragmentational debris as spheres of a density which varied as a function of fragment diameter, where diameter was directly related to mass. Second, it underestimated the generation of fragments smaller than 10-cm in the majority of explosions. Without reliable data from both ground tests and on-orbit breakups, these inadequacies were unavoidable. Recent years, however, have brought additional data and related analyses: results of three ground tests, better on-orbit size and mass estimation techniques, more regular orbital tracking and reporting, additional radar resources dedicated to the observation of small objects, and simply a longer time period with which to observe the debris and their decay. Together these studies and data are applied to the reanalysis of the breakup model. In this paper we compare the new breakup model to the old breakup model in detail, including the size distributions for explosions and collisions, the area-to-mass and impact velocity assignments and distributions, and the delta-velocity distributions. These comparisons demonstrate a significantly better understanding of the fragmentation process as compared to previous versions of EVOLVE.},

	abstract = {Over 120 cases of on-orbit breakups have now been recorded. Many more undetected events are believed to have occurred. Each time an object breaks up, whether by explosion or collision, a cloud of debris is formed. The overall objective of the {PhD} is to examine the interaction between the debris clouds produced by on-orbit fragmentation events and specific space systems. A breakup event will give rise to concentrations of debris which, for some time after the event, will have spatial densities considerably higher than the background flux. Thus, a detailed knowledge of the extent to which the cloud will grow over a given time period, and an accurate assessment of the risk of collision for a spacecraft passing through it, may prove to be important in mission planning and satellite shielding design.},

	abstract = {Numerical integration of orbit trajectories for a large number of initial conditions and for long time spans is computationally expensive. Semi-analytical methods were developed to reduce the computational burden. An elegant and widely used method of semi-analytically integrating trajectories of objects subject to atmospheric drag was proposed by King-Hele (KH). However, the analytical KH contraction method relies on the assumption that the atmosphere density decays strictly exponentially with altitude. If the actual density profile does not satisfy the assumption of a fixed scale height, as is the case for Earth’s atmosphere, the KH method introduces potentially large errors for non-circular orbit configurations. In this work, the KH method is extended to account for such errors by using a newly introduced atmosphere model derivative. By superimposing exponentially decaying partial atmospheres, the superimposed KH method can be applied accurately while considering more complex density profiles. The KH method is further refined by deriving higher order terms during the series expansion. A variable boundary condition to choose the appropriate eccentricity regime, based on the series truncation errors, is introduced. The accuracy of the extended analytical contraction method is shown to be comparable to numerical Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Propagation using the proposed method compares well against non-averaged integration of the dynamics, while the computational load remains very low.},

Two very accurate approaches pushing elliptical and hyperbolic formulations to near parabolic (e.g. e = 0:99999), have been developed.

As an alternative to established numerical and analytical methods, we investigate the accuracy and computational load of the Draper Semi-analytical Satellite Theory (DSST). The Standalone version of the DSST was enhanced with additional perturbation models to improve its recovery of short periodic motion. The accuracy of DSST is, for the first time, compared to a numerical propagator with fidelity force models for a comprehensive grid of low, medium, and high altitude orbits with varying eccentricity and different inclinations. Furthermore, the run-time of both propagators is compared as a function of propagation arc, output step size and gravity field order to assess its performance for a full range of relevant use cases. For use in orbit determination, a robust performance of DSST is demonstrated even in the case of sparse observations, which is most sensitive to mismodeled short periodic perturbations. Overall, DSST is shown to exhibit adequate accuracy at favorable computational speed for the full set of orbits that need to be considered in space surveillance. Along with the inherent benefits of a semi-analytical orbit representation, DSST provides an attractive alternative to the more common numerical orbit propagation techniques.},
